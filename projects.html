                    <p>
                        Here you'll find a collection of my latest projects. I've categorized each project into one of three categories: Cybersecurity,
                        C++ and Web Development. Each project contains a brief description of the project and my goals for completing it as well as relevant
                        skills that were used and developed during the development process!

                                In March of 2024 I successfully completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program hosted on the online learning
                                platform Coursera. Completing this program outfitted with the baseline knowledge that I built on to prepare for the
                                CompTIA Security+ examination.

                                With this project my goal was to undertake as many of the concepts pertaining to object-oriented programming as possible! This
                                console game I built with C++ is inspired by the anime Solo Leveling and encompasses components of Dungeons & Dragons. I was able
                                to experiement with several C++ fundamentals such as abstract classes, dynamic polymorphism, class inheritance and pointers.

                                continued to use Wix for it's security features and communication abilities. However, this time the website better reflects my skills as a
                                developer/designer as it focuses on developing/designing a webpage to achieve business-oriented results and not just look good on a screen.

                                the React.js framework and experimenting a bit using this project as a simple baseline. I still have much to learn to consider myself fluent or proficient
