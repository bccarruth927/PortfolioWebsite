                <h3>A Little About Me!</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Hello! Thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio and getting a glimpse at my experience
                        and skill set when it comes to web and software development as well as cybersecurity. I'm going to keep
                        this professional but still provide an overview into my education, projects and applicable work experience.
                        At the very bottom of this article you can find a downloadable copy of my resume!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beginning with my education, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Digital Media and Web Technology from the
                        University of Maryland Global Campus in August, 2023. This course of study focused primarily on frontend development
                        languages, practices and methodologies and outfitted me with technical skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally,
                        I developed skills in user experience and user interface design, digital media editing and creation softwares such as
                        Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator and briefly worked with the C# programming language which was my first exposure to
                        object-oriented programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing my collegiate education I continued my educational pursuits through online bootcamps provided by resources
                        including <strong>freecodecamp</strong> and <strong>Codecademy</strong>. It was through these online learning platforms that I
                        was able to learn the syntax and a surface-level understanding of a variety of programming languages and frameworks including: React.js, PHP,
                        C++, Java , SQL, Python 3 and relational database management systems. For a more indepth learning experience I am currently
                        enrolling in a series of <strong>Udemy</strong> courses aimed at giving me a better understanding of these languages fundamentals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While pursuing deeper knowledge in programming I have also been pursing learning opportunities pertaining to cybersecurity. Developing applications
                        is one thing, but developing secure applications that are safe for users to utilize and enjoy is another. I completed the Google Cybersecurity
                        Certificate Program in April, 2024. In May, 2024 I successfully obtained my CompTIA Security+ certfication. While at my current employer I have, with
                        permission, been researching and identifying areas of weakness in our IT infastructure and have been making modifications based on my knowledge to
                        make minor improvements to our security posture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit more about me! I am confident that if you take the time to review a little of the work I have
                        completed and take a quick look at my resume you will see the kind of asset I can be to an IT, development or security team.<br>
